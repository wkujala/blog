      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate in Political Science. I wrote my dissertation on the concept of &amp;ldquo;domestic colonialism&amp;rdquo; in the United States, asking whether it could (or should) be reconstructed as an element of anticolonial critical theory today.
My research and reading interests are in:
 Empire, race, and colonialism in political theory Philosophy and history of social science Dialectical philosophy and its relation to philosophy of history Twentieth-century engagements with radicalism in political theory  </description>

      <description>It really is curious just how little work there is directly bearing on the history and theory of decolonization in twentieth-century international relations theory. Because the histories and explanations of particular decolonizing situations &amp;ndash; say, in Malaysia, or Ghana, or Algeria, etc. &amp;ndash; are handed off to historians and students of comparative politics, all that&amp;rsquo;s left for IR theory is, typically, the question of how decolonization both expanded and transformed the international system.</description>
