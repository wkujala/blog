        <h1>Robert Jackson&rsquo;s Quasi-Colonial Apologetics</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content__body">
        <p>It really is curious just how little work there is directly bearing on the history and theory of decolonization in twentieth-century international relations theory. Because the histories and explanations of particular decolonizing situations &ndash; say, in Malaysia, or Ghana, or Algeria, etc. &ndash; are handed off to historians and students of comparative politics, all that&rsquo;s left for IR theory is, typically, the question of how decolonization both expanded and transformed the international system. For example, Christian Reus-Smit&rsquo;s <em>Individual Rights and the Making of the International System</em> places decolonization as a final &ldquo;wave&rdquo; in the expansion of international society. Meanwhile, Neta Crawford&rsquo;s <em>Argument and Change</em> sees it as a sea-change in the basic normative bases of international society, premised on the idea of self-determination.</p>
<p>An earlier work by Robert Jackson is a key &lsquo;English School&rsquo; statement on decolonization in IR. The central argument of Jackson&rsquo;s <em>Quasi-States: Sovereignty, International Relations, and the Third World</em> is that the spread of self-determination as an absolute principle in international society extended international society to &lsquo;new&rsquo; (formerly colonized) peoples, but did so in a way that these states do not have the actual capacity to govern or, in some cases, legitimacy among their populations. They are artificial creations held up by international legal conventions rather than pre-existing political units seeking recognition. Of course, this argument is entirely constructed in opposition to European states, which naturally <em>do</em> perfectly correspond with their &lsquo;peoples,&rsquo; and <em>do</em> have the capacity to govern. Jackson worries in the introduction that he&rsquo;ll be read as an apologist for colonialism, and he&rsquo;s right to do so. I&rsquo;m not sure how anyone could finish this book and think he is anything else.</p>
<p>Siba Grovogui has already swiss-cheesed Jackson&rsquo;s distinction between positive and negative sovereignty in his <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1354066102008003001">&ldquo;Regimes of Sovereignty&rdquo; article</a>. This article basicaly shows the essence of Jackson&rsquo;s argument, which is to demand that postcolonial states be naturally pre-existing units that can stand on their own without international law &ndash; thus having &lsquo;positive&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;negative&rsquo; sovereignty. But as Grovogui points out, many European states, not least Belgium, are prime examples of negative sovereignty. Their capacity and legitimacy is maintained through compromise with other states. In some sense then Jackson ignores a central insight of the English School: that state sovereignty and the international are fundamentally interdependent, and that only nationalist fantasy can lead one to believe that sovereign states somehow stand on their own and then &lsquo;come to&rsquo; international law, totally formed up.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s point is really not just about states being artifacts of international law; it is about domestication. This becomes clear in the case of Denmark. Jackson notes that while Denmark is weak, and small, it nonetheless maintains a &lsquo;domestic reality&rsquo; that he (sometimes rightly) suspects postcolonial states lack. While Denmark has been invaded and all that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Danish government can otherwise provide for its population as well as any state and better than most. Sovereignty for Danes is a tangible good. It is not a question of being a dwarf or a giant among states. Rather, it is a question of being a state in organized domestic reality and not merely by international law (Jackson, 30).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Jackson, postcolonial states are not &lsquo;internally pacified&rsquo; (to borrow an expression from Anthony Giddens). They remain, within themselves, more or less &lsquo;international.&rsquo; In Jackson&rsquo;s colonial apologia, this is because they were decolonized before they were &lsquo;ready,&rsquo; having not yet been brought up through colonial tutelage, which, conveniently, appears to be unique to the British Empire, which throughout the book appears as a kind daddy. There&rsquo;s no mention of the rationale and material basis of colonization, which requires that colonial tutelage <em>never</em> ends, and that the colonized be put in the &ldquo;waiting room of history.&rdquo; In this text, the problem is that the colonized have burst out of the waiting room. The barbarians aren&rsquo;t just at the gates. They are running the show, passing resolutions in the General Assembly. '</p>
<p>On the other hand, postcolonial states are <em>too</em> domesticating, running roughshod over Indigenous populations (the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/past/article-abstract/242/1/227/5298765">Naga people in India could be an example here</a>). The artificial identification of the state with the &lsquo;people&rsquo; and the &lsquo;nation&rsquo; &ndash; something he thinks is unique to postcolonial space but is in fact true everywhere&hellip; &ndash; encloses peoples who might otherwise have the right to self-determination within a nation-state with relatively arbitrary boundaries. Jackson thus makes a point that is very much valuable in the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;decolonization ironically was not only a liberation movement but also an enclosure movemnet: it confined populations within ex-colonial frontiers and subjected them to indigenous governments which often were not only untried and inexperienced but also unable or unwilling to operate in accordance to humanitarian standards (151).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He therefore points out that the universalization of self-determination came with a flexibility that accorded it to some while &lsquo;domesticating&rsquo; other claims within &lsquo;new states.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The irony is that Jackson enacts precisely this move in his reading of the politics of decolonization. He argues that the biggest reason behind the too-speedy decolonization of Africa was the &ldquo;internationalization of the decolonization issue,&rdquo; which he reads as an &ldquo;ultimately successful attack on the traditional right of domestic jurisdiction over colonial territories&rdquo; (105). This basically eroded the possibility of the continuation of colonial tutelage in new forms, whether these be confederation or more autonomy within empires. What was the properly &lsquo;domestic&rsquo; jurisdiction of empires was read as a potentially international space. Amazingly, Jackson makes hardly any reference to those within Africa demanding this; always it is from above, or out of nowhere, that &lsquo;internationalization&rsquo; occurs. The point is that there was an internationalizing already going on; this is what forces the hand of colonizers, not a shift in the normative basis of international order. Jackson misreads the legal mechanism by which decolonization was <em>contained</em> as the motor behind it.</p>
<p>But this leads to what I think is the most amazing moment in this book. He argues that one of the biggest defenses of the imperial powers of their &lsquo;domestic jurisdiction&rsquo; in Africa was that if one was to <em>truly</em> universalize the principle of self-determination outlined in the UN Charter, it would no doubt apply in <em>Europe</em> too! Thus, as indeed does happen, the Basque, the Flemish, the Irish, whatever, will claim their own state, and not only will empires fall but states will disintegrate! No doubt this spectre was looming over Jackson awaiting the 1990s. One wonders, of course, whether he thinks the disintegration of the USSR along these principles would be so bad. At any rate, he argues that this Belgian argument &ldquo;disclosed the ambiguity and hypocrisy in the decolonization argument&rdquo; (106). As he writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Numerous independent countries contain non-self-governing territorial groups which may or may not be permitted to participate constitutionally and equally in the political life of the ruling community. Domestic legal and administrative arrangements of a paternalist kind  sometimes exist for dealing with them &ndash; such as the specialized laws, bureaucracies, and policies by which American, Canada, and Australian governments have historically ruled aboriginal peoples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus ironically the Belgian defense &ndash; which turned on the terrifying consequences of extending self-determination in an <em>actually universal fashion</em> &ndash; had to be repressed because &ldquo;it probed the &lsquo;internal colonialism&rsquo; of too many existing independent countries, developed and underdeveloped alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Jackson uses the hypocrisy of the US, Canadian, and Australian limitation of self-determination within their states in the face of worldwide decolonization as a sign of the hypocrisy of decolonization in general. His work thus reads as the inverse of my own (in my dissertation): the &lsquo;domestication&rsquo; of Canada and the United States is basically artifical &ndash; and oppressive &ndash; but for Jackson this is not a reason to think about what an &lsquo;internationalization&rsquo; of these spaces looks like but a reason for sympathy with colonizers with overseas empires. His book therefore ironically could be the basis of a criticism of <strong>the negative sovereignty of settler states</strong>: the fact that they are basically <em>also</em> artificial creations of international law, and not least international law between themselves and Indigenous peoples, and that the international system works as a basic bulwark against Indigenous and Black claims to self-determination in North America. For this is <strong>precisely</strong> what the US and Canada were worried about during decolonization: that it would reveal all-too-clearly their &lsquo;internal colonialisms.&rsquo; Jackson&rsquo;s argument that African states received a sort of international legal &lsquo;affirmative action&rsquo; (161) can thus be turned against settler states, which are legally incomplete (illegal occupations of Indigenous land) and incapable of governing (insofar as they commit genocide). For many living in their borders, sovereignty is not a &lsquo;tangible good&rsquo; &ndash; it is a mechanism of capture. These states' continuing existence occurs through a combination of force and recognition within international society, held up &lsquo;negatively&rsquo; through a set of exemptions from international ethics.</p>
